# Data Analyst - DAND - Udacity

### [P1 - Exploring Weather Trends](https://github.com/MHAbido/DataAnalyst-DAND-Udacity/tree/master/P1-ExploringWeatherTrends) : 
- In this project, you will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.

### [P2 - Bike Share Analysis](https://github.com/MHAbido/DataAnalyst-DAND-Udacity/tree/master/P2-BikeShareAnalysis) :
- In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. You will perform data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and write code to compute descriptive statistics. You will also make use of a package that is not part of the standard Python library to help you visualize the data.

### [P3 - Investigate A Dataset](https://github.com/MHAbido/DataAnalyst-DAND-Udacity/tree/master/P3-InvestigateDataset) : 
- In this project, you will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. You will use the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

### [P4 - Analyze AB Test Results](https://github.com/MHAbido/DataAnalyst-DAND-Udacity/tree/master/P4-AnalyzeABTestResults) :
- In this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

### [P5 - Test A Perceptual Phenomenon](https://github.com/MHAbido/DataAnalyst-DAND-Udacity/tree/master/P5-TestPerceptualPhenomenon) :
- In this project, you will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. You will learn a little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task yourself. You will then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, you will interpret your results in terms of your hypotheses.

### [P6 - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)](https://github.com/MHAbido/DataAnalyst-DAND-Udacity/tree/master/P6-EDA) :
- In this project, you will use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

### [P7 - Wrangle and Analyze Data](https://github.com/MHAbido/DataAnalyst-DAND-Udacity/tree/master/P7-DataWrangling) : 
- Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, you will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. You will document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.

### [P8 - Data Story Telling Using Tableau](https://github.com/MHAbido/DataAnalyst-DAND-Udacity/tree/master/P8-DataVisualizationUsingTableau) :
- For this project, you will create a data visualization using Tableau that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in a data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
